# Documentation for RDF form

RDF form provides rendered forms via a form definition provided in RDF turtle format.
It is easy to serialize to JSON-ld or turtle.
This form builder is extendable and is build as generic as possible.

Use cases:
- Reuse form definitions across applications
- Separation of concerns, one person manages the data object and form, the other develops a program.
